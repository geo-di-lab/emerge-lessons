There is no exact number of mosquito predator species. Though we've named five in this chapter, there's a wide variety of species across a wide range of taxonomic groups. If there's any species that you specifically would like to map out alongside GLOBE & iNaturalist Mosquito observations, this is a tutorial on how to accomplish that.

If you would like a species added to our Github so that you don't have to download/upload anything, feel free to contact us with any requests!

## Step One - Go to iNaturalist's website and look up your species

## Step Three - Add any other filters you would like and then click Create Export
*If your search query has over 20,000 observations, you may need to add more filters to bring the number below the limit. Also, make sure you're logged in*
