# Why Analyze Data?

If you’ve collected data through citizen science—or are considering it—you might wonder: what happens next? Why do we analyze data? And how does analysis turn raw observations into meaningful knowledge?

This chapter explains **why analyzing data is essential** to environmental science, community action, and public health. Whether you’re a student, educator, community leader, or curious participant, this lesson will show how analysis helps us answer questions, find patterns, and make informed decisions.

## What Is Data Analysis?

In simple terms, **data analysis is the process of examining data to draw conclusions**. It involves organizing, visualizing, interpreting, and sometimes modeling information to:
- Identify trends or changes over time
- Spot patterns or outliers
- Compare one place or group to another
- Support a hypothesis or answer a research question
- Make decisions based on evidence

Data can take many forms—numbers, maps, photos, GPS coordinates, or even checklists. GLOBE Observer data, for instance, includes:
- Geotagged photos of land cover
- Mosquito larvae counts and habitat descriptions
- Time and date stamps
- Weather and environmental conditions

Each data point alone is helpful, but **when we analyze many observations together**, we begin to see bigger pictures.

## Why Analysis Matters for EMERGE

The EMERGE project is about more than collecting data—it’s about using data to understand **environmental change** and **public health risks**, especially related to mosquito-borne disease and land use.

By analyzing land cover observations, we can:
- See how vegetation and water coverage vary across regions
- Identify places at higher risk for heat, flooding, or pollution
- Understand how green space contributes to resilience

By analyzing mosquito habitat data, we can:
- Pinpoint mosquito breeding hotspots
- Compare mosquito presence before and after a storm
- Predict where health departments might need to focus resources

Analysis helps turn **community-collected data into community knowledge**. It empowers you to say not just *"Here's what I saw"* but *"Here's what it means."*

## Examples of Questions You Can Explore
- Where are most mosquito larvae being found in my city?
- How does land cover vary between neighborhoods?
- Do mosquito habitats increase after heavy rainfall?
- What kinds of environments seem to attract mosquitoes?
- Are certain areas missing green space or vegetation?

In upcoming lessons, we’ll show you how to:
- Explore and download data from GLOBE Observer
- Visualize data with charts and maps
- Create insights you can share with your school, library, or local government

## Conclusion: From Observation to Action
Data collection is the first step. **Analysis is what gives data power**.

By analyzing what you and others observe, you contribute to science, inform public decisions, and help your community adapt to a changing world. Whether you’re building a science fair project, informing local leaders, or simply satisfying your curiosity—data analysis connects you to a larger story.
