# Sharing Your Findings

Once you’ve collected data, analyzed it, and crafted a story — the final step is sharing what you’ve found with others. Whether you’re presenting to classmates, emailing a city official, hosting a library event, or uploading results to a public site, **sharing your findings helps turn data into action**.

In this lesson, we’ll explore the **how, where, and why** of sharing your results with your community and the broader world.

## Why Sharing Matters
Sharing your findings:
- **Closes the loop**: It shows others what you’ve discovered and why it matters.
- **Builds community knowledge**: Your work might highlight patterns others haven’t noticed — like mosquito hotspots after rainfall, or declining tree cover in certain areas.
- **Informs decision-making**: Local leaders and organizations can use your data to plan interventions, from public health to urban planning.
- **Celebrates science**: Publicly sharing your work promotes science as a collaborative, accessible process anyone can participate in.

## Where You Can Share
You don’t need a scientific journal to share your findings (although that’s great too!). Here are some options:

- Local Presentations
    - Share with your school, library, city council, or neighborhood association.
    - Use simple visuals like maps, graphs, and photos.
    - Offer printed handouts or slide decks that summarize your key points.
- StoryMaps and Data Visualizations
    - Platforms like ArcGIS StoryMaps allow you to combine narrative, photos, maps, and data.
    - Use EMERGE templates or data tools to build compelling visuals.
- Online Platforms
    - Upload your data or story to project pages on [SciStarter](https://scistarter.org/) or [CitSci](https://citsci.org/).
    - Post short summaries or photos on social media using hashtags like #CitizenScience, #GLOBEObserver, or #DataCamp.
- Classroom or Library Exhibits
    - Create posters, infographics, or zines to display.
    - Host a “data fair” or mini science expo to engage others with your findings.
- Public Submissions and Feedback
    - Submit your findings to local agencies (like mosquito control or parks departments).
    - Ask for feedback or recommendations from your audience.

## What to Include in a Public-Facing Share-Out
No matter how you choose to share, make sure your message includes:

1. Your question
    What were you hoping to learn or understand?
2. Your method
    What tools did you use? What data did you collect?
3. Your key findings
    What patterns, trends, or surprises did you discover?
4. Your call to action
    What should your audience do next — learn more, take action, spread the word?

## Optional: Formalize Your Work
If you want to take it further, consider:
- Turning your work into a science fair project
- Writing a blog or op-ed
- Contributing to a student research journal
- Submitting to [GLOBE's student research platform](https://www.globe.gov/web/united-states-of-america/home/student-research-symposia)

## Final Thoughts
Sharing your findings brings your work full circle. You’ve observed the world, interpreted what you’ve seen, and now you’re helping others understand and act.

In EMERGE, we believe that science is strongest when it’s **shared, inclusive, and grounded in community**. Your voice — and your data — matter.

Now go tell your story.
