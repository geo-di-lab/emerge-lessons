# Welcome to EMERGE

EMERGE aims to Engage Communities in Environmental Research and Geospatial Education. It is a statewide initiative that helps libraries, educators, and individuals across Florida engage in public health and environmental science using real-world data tools and citizen science.

Through mobile tools like GLOBE Observer, participants help monitor mosquito breeding sites, classify land cover, and contribute data to global scientific efforts.

This digital textbook includes interactive coding tutorials designed to introduce you to the amazing capabilities of participatory science and geospatial analysis.
