# Communicate the Science

Science doesn’t end when the data is collected or analyzed — in many ways, that’s just the beginning. Sharing what you’ve learned is essential to making a difference. Whether you’re giving a talk at your local library, posting on social media, or building a story map for your city government, the goal is the same: help others understand why your findings matter.

This chapter focuses on how to **communicate science effectively** — especially when your data comes from community observations, citizen science, and tools like GLOBE Observer. Good science communication makes technical information understandable, engaging, and actionable.

## Why Communicate Science?
Communicating science is about more than just presenting facts — it’s about connecting with people. Here’s why it matters:

- **Informs decision-making**: Sharing your findings with local leaders, teachers, or residents can help guide real-world actions, like draining standing water to reduce mosquito risk.
- **Builds trust**: Open communication helps people trust both the process and results of community science.
- **Encourages participation**: When people see others presenting data and getting involved, they’re more likely to contribute themselves.
- **Creates change**: When data is communicated clearly, it can inspire action — from policy to personal behavior.

## What Makes Communication Effective?
Good science communication is:

- **Accurate**: Stick to what your data shows. Be honest about what you know and what you’re still figuring out.
- **Audience-aware**: Tailor your message to who you’re talking to — a classroom of students, a town council, or neighbors on social media might each need a different approach.
- **Clear and jargon-free**: Avoid technical terms when you can, or define them clearly if you need to use them.
- **Visual**: Maps, graphs, photos, and drawings can make your data more accessible and powerful.
- **Personal**: People respond to stories. Don’t just share your data — share your journey, your observations, and why the work matters to you.

## Connecting Data to Storytelling
Every dataset tells a story — the story of a place, a season, a change, or a risk. For example:
- A mosquito habitat map could tell the story of how one neighborhood is taking steps to prevent disease.
- A series of land cover photos could show how green spaces in a city have changed over time — and why that matters for heat, flooding, or biodiversity.
- A student-led GLOBE project might highlight how youth are monitoring their community and taking environmental action.

Ask yourself:
- What question did you try to answer?
- What patterns did you see in your data?
- Who might care about these findings?
- What do you want them to know, feel, or do after hearing from you?

## Tools to Help You Share
Depending on your audience and goals, you can communicate your findings in different formats:

- **StoryMaps**: Combine maps, text, images, and video to create an interactive digital story. [Learn about ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/).
- **Infographics**: Simple, visual summaries of your findings. Tools like Canva or Piktochart can help you build your own.
- **Posters and zines**: Great for libraries, community centers, or schools. Check out our EMERGE poster templates.
- **Social media posts**: Quick and engaging — perfect for sharing key findings or photos from the field.
- **Presentations**: Prepare short talks for events, classes, or community groups. See our “Data Camp” slide decks for inspiration.

## Communicating with a Purpose
Science communication doesn’t have to be fancy or technical. It just has to be thoughtful.

Ask yourself:
- Who am I trying to reach?
- What do I want them to understand or do?
- What’s the best format to deliver this message?

In the next lessons, you’ll explore examples of public-facing science projects and learn how to create your own communication materials using data you’ve collected or analyzed during EMERGE.

Remember: **Data becomes powerful when it’s shared**.
