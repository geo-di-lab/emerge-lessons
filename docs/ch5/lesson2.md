# Host Your Own Data Camp

Want to get your library, classroom, or organization involved in environmental research and public health? You can host your own **EMERGE Data Camp** using our free tools and open-access curriculum.

Data Camps are flexible, hands-on programs where participants learn how to collect, analyze, and share real data using NASA’s [GLOBE Observer](https://observer.globe.gov/) tools—specifically the **Mosquito Habitat Mapper** and **Land Cover** projects. No prior experience or technical background is required.

## What Is a Data Camp?
An EMERGE Data Camp is a public-facing science event that can be:
- A one-hour workshop or a multi-day series
- In-person or virtual
- Led by librarians, educators, Ambassadors, students, or volunteers
- For learners of all ages

Data Camps teach participants how to:
- Use the GLOBE Observer mobile app
- Identify and report mosquito breeding habitats or land cover
- Visualize local environmental data
- Ask questions, analyze trends, and communicate findings

## Why Host One?
- Engage your community in meaningful science
- Build public awareness around mosquito-borne disease and climate resilience
- Contribute real data to a global NASA-supported initiative
- Empower learners with data literacy and problem-solving skills
- Apply for a [$300 mini-grant](https://geoemerge.com/mini-grants-for-libraries-community-based-organizations/) by July 31, 2025 at 5 PM EST to support your program (optional)
